'''
This is where I upload all my practice code and projects.
I've been diligently grinding out the 100 days of code challenge.
Most of the code here I've spent at least an hour or more on (minus the practice ones, those are just my learning resources)
Right now, it just looks like a jumbled mess. That's because this is my personal repository, not an actual showcase.
I'll make a different Python repository just for showcasing my best work.
Thanks for reading!

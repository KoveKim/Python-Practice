# For loop practice

#for letter in "Khristian":  # For every letter in "x", do something that many times
#    print(letter)

friends = ["Luis", "Chris", "Jason", "Ben", "Jeourdin"]
#for friend in friends:  # The variable after "for" can be anything
#    print(friend)

#for index in range(3, 10):  # You can use this to loop iterations
#    print(index)

for index in range(len(friends)):
    print(friends[3])  # Change the number to anything or change to index
